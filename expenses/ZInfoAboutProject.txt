This file contains detail explanation of the procedure and components I used to make this expense tracker application.
1) In installed app I used django.contrib.humanize
	What it does is it is used to view dates in human readable format
	Examples (when ‘today’ is 17 Feb 2007):
	16 Feb 2007 becomes yesterday.
	17 Feb 2007 becomes today
	18 Feb 2007 becomes tomorrow.
	Examples (when ‘now’ is 17 Feb 2007 16:30:00):
	17 Feb 2007 16:30:00 becomes now.
	17 Feb 2007 16:29:31 becomes 29 seconds ago.
	17 Feb 2007 16:29:00 becomes a minute ago.
	17 Feb 2007 16:25:35 becomes 4 minutes ago.
